#+TITLE: ESP32-C3 Introduction

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
ESP32-C3 is a single-core, 32-bit, RISC-V-based MCU with 400KB of SRAM,
which is capable of running at 160MHz. It has integrated 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth 5 (LE) with a long-range support. It has 22 programmable
GPIOs with support for ADC, SPI, UART, I2C, I2S, RMT, TWAI, and PWM.

The greatest thing about this microcontroller is [[https://web.archive.org/web/20230210094703/https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804808307079.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt&_randl_shipto=US][how cheap it is]]. On AliExpress
it costs a mere 2.65 USD each. I bought two of these which in total cost
8.07 USD with shipping included, which is 4.035 USD each. It's also quite
nice that the ESP32-C3 uses a RISC-V architecture. LLVM currently doesn't
support Xtensa by default (which the ESP32 uses), and Rust depends on LLVM.
I'd much rather use Rust than C for programming microcontrollers.
