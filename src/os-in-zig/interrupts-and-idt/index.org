#+TITLE: Interrupts and IDT

After setting up the console, we are going to set up interrupts. With interrupts
we unlock many things, such as keyboard input. To set up interrupts we need
to initialize the [[https://wiki.osdev.org/Interrupt_Descriptor_Table][Interrupt Descriptor Table]]. Usually we would also need
to set up the [[https://wiki.osdev.org/Global_Descriptor_Table][Global Descriptor Table]], but GRUB does this for us.
