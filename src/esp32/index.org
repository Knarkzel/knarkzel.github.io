#+TITLE: ESP32

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A feature-rich MCU with integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity for
a wide-range of applications.

The ESP32 is essentially a more powerful version of the ESP32-C3 (except
for Bluetooth). It features a dual-core CPU instead of single-core, with
more RAM and ROM. One major downside for me at least is that it uses the
Xtensa architecture instead of ARM or RISC-V. Since LLVM doesn't have Xtensa
support yet, and Rust depends on LLVM, I can't use Rust for programming
the ESP32 as easily as the ESP32-C3. There are however forks of LLVM with
Xtensa support, and it seems like Xtensa support will come soon.

Nevertheless, this is also a great microcontroller [[https://web.archive.org/web/20230210110857/https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804810550191.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt&_randl_shipto=US][that's very cheap]]. On
AliExpress it costs 3.54 USD each. With shipping it's probably around 4-5
USD.
