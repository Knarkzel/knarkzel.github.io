#+TITLE: Lisp interpreter in Rust

In this blog series we create a small Lisp interpreter in the Rust programming
language. Each post is a small tutorial and include all needed code with some theory. 

1. [[./hello-lisp][Hello, Lisp]]
2. Functions and variables
3. Implementing core language features
4. Creating Lisp in Lisp (meta-circular evaluator)
